### Description
Machine learning is, without a doubt, one of the hottest topics in the world right now. Most
companies are using it, or planning to use it, for many applications. Some people dub machine
learning as the new electricity, or the new industrial revolution. I would go a bit farther and
call it the new renaissance. Why? Because in the Renaissance, progress was made in the arts,
the sciences, engineering, mathematics, and almost all the fields by the same people. With
machine learning, this is finally possible again. With a strong knowledge of machine learning,
one is able to derive cutting edge results in almost any field one decides to apply them, and
this is fascinating. And that is what this book is for, to get you up to speed with the fastmoving world of machine learning!

### About

What is machine learning? I define it as “common sense, but for a computer.” What
does this mean? It means that machine learning is the practice of getting computers
to make decisions using the decision-making process that we, humans, utilize in our daily life.

Humans make many decisions based on past experiences, and we can teach this decision making process to the computer, with the difference that computers call their past
experiences “data.

”Most approaches to machine learning require a heavy amount of mathematics, in
particular, linear algebra, calculus, and probability. While a solid understanding of
these topics is very useful for learning machine learning, I strongly believe that they
are not absolutely necessary. What is needed to understand machine learning is a
visual mind, an intuition of basic probability, and a strong desire to learn.
In this book, I present machine learning as a series of exercises of increasing difficulty, in
which the final goal is to teach a computer how to take a particular decision. Each chapter is
dedicated to a different machine learning algorithm, and is focused in one use-case of this
algorithm, such as spam detection, language analysis, image recognition, and so on.
